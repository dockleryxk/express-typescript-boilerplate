# Express TS Boilerplate

## Introduction

This is a minimal boilerplate for messing with Express and Typescript. Both frontend and backend live reload.

Ngrok is throw in too in case you want to use it for some reason (e.g. testing webhooks).

## Usage

1. Install dependencies with `yarn` or `npm`.
2. Secondly, rename the `example.env` file to `.env` and fill in the desired port.
3. Run `npm start` to host the application on the specified port.
